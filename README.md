## 📊 UI Components

### 1. Input Section
- **Stock Selector**: Dropdown with popular stocks (RELIANCE.NS, TCS.NS, AAPL, GOOGL, etc.)
- **Date Range**: Start and end date pickers for training data
- **Predict Button**: Triggers the prediction process

### 2. Price Chart
- **Historical Prices**: Line chart showing past stock movement
- **Predicted Price**: Green dot showing next-day prediction
- **Interactive**: Hover tooltips with exact values

### 3. Results Display
- **Current Price**: Latest closing price from data
- **Predicted Price**: LSTM model's next-day prediction
- **Expected Change**: Percentage change (green/red colored)
- **Decision**: BUY/SELL/HOLD based on prediction
- **Confidence**: Algorithm confidence score (50-95%)

## 🧠 How It Works

### Data Preparation
1. Download historical stock data using `yfinance`
2. Extract closing prices
3. Normalize data using MinMaxScaler (0-1 range)
4. Create sequences of 60 days to predict day 61

### LSTM Training
1. Build sequential model with 2 LSTM layers
2. Add dropout for regularization (prevents overfitting)
3. Train on historical sequences
4. Optimize using Adam algorithm

### Prediction Logic
1. Take last 60 days of data
2. Feed into trained LSTM model
3. Get predicted price for next day
4. Calculate % change from current price

### Decision Algorithm
```
if change > +1.5%  → BUY  (confidence: 75-95%)
if change < -1.5%  → SELL (confidence: 75-95%)
else              → HOLD (confidence: 50-70%)
```
